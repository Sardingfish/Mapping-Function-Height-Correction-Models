This repository provides a matlab script for obtaining the mapping function coefficient `a` for a user-specified height location from the tropospheric delay mapping function height correction models' parameters we provided.

Paper title: "A novel method for tropospheric delay mapping function vertical modeling"

## Background

 In high-precision space geodetic techniques data processing, the mapping function (MF) is a key factor in mapping the radio waves from the zenith direction down to the signal incoming direction. Existing MF products, either site-wise Vienna Mapping Function (VMF1 and VMF3) or grid-wise VMF1 and VMF3, are only available at the Earth surface, for overhead areas, height correction is always required. This is getting more and more crucial, particularly in today's world when air-borne aircraft activities are on the rise. In this contribution, we introduce a novel method aimed at providing a large number of MFs to the user in a simple and efficient manner, while minimizing the loss of precision. This innovative approach effectively represents the vertical profile of the MFs from the Earth's surface up to altitudes of 14 km.

The goal of this repository is to help users recover tropospheric delay mapping functions for user-specified height locations from the model parameters we provide.
